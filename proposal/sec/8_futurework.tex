\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Try different fusion model and operation method such as CNN, Attention, ELAN(which in YOLO V7) and different distillation method such as: Flatten level, MaxPool level, Cosine loss, MSE loss to improve the segmentation performance both in dice and model size;
  \item General framework with multi-model fusion and knowledge distillation to do the segmentation task,and using this framework to improve the EF prediction model;
  \item In addition to Cardiac Monitoring, it is also expected to be used in Angiography,  Lung, Brain, Mammography  and other image processing such as defect detecting and so on;
  \item EchoNet-Dynamic	 Data:7.04 GB, December 2020
Access the dataset via the Stanford Artificial Intelligence in Medicine and Imaging (AIMI) Center Shared Datasets Portal. Pls registor and follow the rules.
  \item Videos or pictures generated not only by ultrasonic but also by X-ray,  CT, MRI, Electron Microscope,or Common Picture;
  \item 3D, 4D (3D with time) re-build, seems cool but also very hard work
\end{itemize}
