\section{Results}

For the test dataset from Stanford Medicine, Trained on echocardiogram videos, the original model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92 and 311 MB of model size, predicts ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 4.1\% and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, area under the curve of 0.97. Our project focus on the segments the left ventricle,and the result as following:
