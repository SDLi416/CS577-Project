Despite significant advances in the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in recent years, heart disease remains the leading cause of adult mortality worldwide. This is partly due to the fact that most of the body's organs are strongly dependent on the oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange brought about by the blood circulation, and that an abnormality in the heart's pumping capacity can cause irreversible damage to organs throughout the body in a short period of time (3-8 minutes).

But human assessment of cardiac function is mainly focused on the limited monitoring of cardiac beat cycles. Even after years of training, physicians may still have large divergent biases or omissions in their assessment conclusions of the observed person in the face of rare diseases and emergencies, which is a great potential danger to both doctors and patients.Therefore, rapid, efficient, cost-effective, accurate, reproducible and quantifiable assessment of cardiac function is essential for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease as well as for determining the choice of clinical treatment options for critically ill patients.

To overcome this challenge, we present "Fusion Modeling \& Knowledge Distillation Optimization" which based on a video-based deep learning algorithm—EchoNet-Dynamic—, that uses multiple models for feature extraction, and outperforms of human experts in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction, and evaluating cardiomyopathy while greatly reducing the arithmetic requirements. It is simple to use, requires little or no parameter tuning, and can be run quickly on a personal computer.
