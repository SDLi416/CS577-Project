\section{Evaluation of model performance}

For the test dataset from Stanford Medicine that was not previously seen during model training, the prediction of the ejection fraction by EchoNet-Dynamic had a mean absolute error of 4.1\%, root mean squared error of 5.3\% and R2 of 0.81 compared with the annotations by human experts. This is well within the range of typical measurement variation between different clinicians, which is usually described as inter-observer variation and can be as high as 13.9\%. Wait for result
