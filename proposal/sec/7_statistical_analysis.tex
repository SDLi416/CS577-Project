\section{Statistical analysis}

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Confidence intervals were computed using 10,000 bootstrapped samples and obtaining 95 percentile ranges for each prediction. The performance of the semantic segmentation task was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient compared with the human labels from the held-out test dataset. The performance of the ejection fraction task was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute difference between the prediction of EchoNet-Dynamic and the human calculation of ejection fraction as well as calculating the R2 between the prediction by EchoNet-Dynamic and the human calculation. Prospective comparison with human readers was performed with the uniformly most powerful invariant equivalence test for two-sample problems.
